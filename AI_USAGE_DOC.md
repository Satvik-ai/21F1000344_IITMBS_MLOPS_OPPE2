I used ChatGPT. I explained the problem statement
For the architecture, I did'nt need any help
I used my codes from weekly assignments
I asked ChatGPT in case of some errors
Overall, I can say that I did 90% myself, and 10% with ChatGPT help. 
Thankfully, I had my files from weekly assignmemnts, which saved me for the day.
