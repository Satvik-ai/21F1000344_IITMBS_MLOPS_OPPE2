I primarily developed this project independently after clearly defining and understanding the problem statement. The system architecture was designed without external assistance, and I reused and adapted code from my weekly assignments to build the solution efficiently.

I consulted ChatGPT occasionally to troubleshoot specific errors and clarify minor implementation issues. Overall, I would estimate that about 90% of the work was completed independently, with 10% supported by ChatGPT for debugging and guidance.

Having organized files and resources from previous assignments significantly streamlined the development process and helped me complete the project efficiently.
